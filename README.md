### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Full Stack Software Developer | Salesforce Success Graduate Participant| 
## About me ðŸ‘‹

I see myself as a product of consulting, education and tech. 

I previously worked as an Environmental Scientist where I collaborated with engineers to mitigate the impact of development. My technical interest is a result of a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Predictive Analytics) and a participant in the Salesforce Success Graduate Programme. While studying for my Software Development Diploma I worked in education as a Senior Teacher, where I supported both teachers and school to reach common goals.

My attention to detail and curiosity to learn fuels my eager approach to challenges using a client-focused mindset. I spend my free time working on additional courses so that I can expand my technical skillset and keep up to date as a career switcher.

I am excited to connect and share my experiences, so feel free to reach out!
